# AmpexCodeBase

Code base for the Ampex project
(https://www.ampex-igluna.com)

consist of MQTT Server, visual GUI and hardware codes for the Continous Fiber Spinning Machine

maintained by: Reis Baltaoglu

# Motivation
In the near future mankind will make it's first attemps of space colonization, and one of our biggest diffuclties 
will be finding material to engineer tools that we need.

To address this problem we are building a Continous Fiber Spinning Machine, that will produce automatically fiber
needed for fiber composite materials

# Goals
*  Automate a Continous Fiber Spinning Machine, with remote control and continous data logging (WIP)
*  Optimize hardware for the moon conditions 
*  Network multiple machines for mass fiber production
